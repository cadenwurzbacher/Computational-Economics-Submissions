    "For my computational economics project, I am trying to solve the problem that is the lack of information on cost-of-living data based on location. I am also attempting to provide an explanation for the factors the affect housing prices. To solve this problem, I will be analyzing the factors that impact housing prices relative to per capita income. As of now, I would be performing an analysis of the most populated city in each state, as well as each state as a whole. I will use beautiful soup to scrape the data from city-data.com. This website contains data such as per capita income and median house value for most cities across the country. My goal for this project is to provide individuals with an accurate idea of what portion of their income would go towards housing in certain locations, as well as an explanation of why this is. Ultimately, I think this will help young professionals and recent college grads find an affordable place to live. "
